#^ Shebang line tells to execute this file using the Bash shell.

#x Function returns works differently to other languages.
#x Opposite to others, in BASH, a returned 0 means success and a returned 1 is fail (contrasting the 1=true and 0=false).
#x This is because BASH returns are for status codes rather then boolean.
#x Source: https://labex.io/tutorials/shell-bash-function-return-values-391153#understanding-function-return-codes .
#x This is important to know because if-statments will only return true if called function returns 0.

#x Used ShellCheck (https://www.shellcheck.net/) to help enforce good BASH programming practice.

#x Developer made sure to add semi-colon at the end of all appropiate lines a stricter but better programming practice.

#x Each displayed text for reading/inputing has ": " at the end as as having the user's input right next to the display text (like "Type a number hereseventy-five") will be disorientating for the user.
